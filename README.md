# 🧠 CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship Project – Amazon Reviews

Welcome to my Data Analytics internship project with **CodeAlpha**!  
This repository showcases 3 powerful tasks demonstrating my skills in **Web Scraping**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and **Data Visualization**, all centered around **Amazon-style review data**.

---

## 📌 Overview

| Task | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| ✅ Task 1 | **Web Scraping (Demo)** | Scraped mock Amazon-like reviews using `BeautifulSoup` from a demo e-commerce site. Collected book titles, prices, and availability info. |
| ✅ Task 2 | **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Performed deep EDA on the real **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset from Kaggle, analyzing review patterns, distributions, and sentiment indicators. |
| ✅ Task 3 | **Data Visualization** | Created interactive and informative visualizations to uncover insights about customer behavior, review trends, and product performance. |
